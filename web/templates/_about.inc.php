<h3 style="margin-top: -11px;">About Detector</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/dmolsen/Detector">Detector</a> is a simple, PHP- and JavaScript-based browser- and feature-detection library. Detector gives
	server-side developers information about what types of devices may be requesting their content as well as the HTML5 &amp; CSS3 features a requesting browser may or may not support. With Detector a developer 
	can serve the appropriate markup, stylesheets, and JavaScript to a requesting browser without being completely dependent on a browser-detection library being up-to-date nor completely dependent on a front-end-only resource loader.
