Things to Implement for Detector

x - separating core tests from user-supplied tests, and saving that data separately...
  - how to version the data?
x - how to have "core" feature detection that updates server-side but gets run every time (e.g. DPI which doesn't track w/ UA string)
  - sampling the data so that we can update properties just in case
  - have a way to update extended even if core tests exist
  - how do we version control the data and share across sites? i assume a separate repo for user-agents (user-agents-core vs user-agents-extended)
x - need a good README
x - document the code
x - need a good demo
  - offer an api into the data
x - BUG: issue with cookies and sessions dying
  - BUG: media query core tests not working properly (works locally but not on iOS 5?)
x - add support for an archive feature so others can view the already saved profiles
