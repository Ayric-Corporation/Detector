Things to Implement for Detector

x - separating core tests from user-supplied tests, and saving that data separately...
  - how to version the data?
x - how to have "core" feature detection that updates server-side but gets run every time (e.g. DPI which doesn't track w/ UA string)
  - sampling the data so that we can update properties just in case
  - have a way to update extended even if core tests exist
  - how do we version control the data and share across sites? i assume a separate repo for user-agents (user-agents-core vs user-agents-extended)
x - need a good README
x - document the code
x - need a good demo
  - offer an api into the data
x - BUG: issue with cookies and sessions dying
  - BUG: media query core tests not working properly (works locally but not on iOS 5?)
x - add support for an archive feature so others can view the already saved profiles
x - update the wording for the headers for features. also add a background color.
x - add noscript tag to the default to capture spiders & devices that don't support js
x - figure out a default profile for spiders & what not... (how does $ua->feature react to not being present?)
  - add check if user-agents-extended has been created and build if necessary.
  - a way to skip ahead in browser profiles or someway to search across profiles/organize
x - figure out a way to check if it's an ios app?
  - write the introductory blog post
  - revise the README
x - support for objects from Modernizr, add example tests for that (screenSize?)
x - add a google analytics include
  - add an onwindowresize event to capture certain attributes like size? seems overkill...
x - add a true archive page so some can see the full user agent string...
x - add a method to store the user agents in a flat file so they can be pulled out for the archive page & side bar. { uahash => ua }?
x - social media buttons
